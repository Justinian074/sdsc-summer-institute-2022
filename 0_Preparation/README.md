# Preparing for the SDSC Summer Institute 2021
7/28/21 - [Prep Day Recording](https://ucsd.zoom.us/rec/play/bcUnoeSmHStcgMAi3fU95_fDpH8DtS1qsDVutXKcMCL3s7EFJ3hIxaHQ_ErLUge5ukd8zW-tkQ1opg.q3UJUrf_MCaEGnWs)

You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of this workshop, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse, to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

## Expanse User Guide <a name="expanse-guide"></a>
Please read the Expanse user guide and familiarize yourself with the hardware, file systems, batch job submission, compilers and modules. The guide can be found here:
* [Expanse User Guide](https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/expanse.html)

##  Account Requirements: <a name="accounts"></a>
* You will be given an XSEDE training account to access the Expanse portal. Information on the account will be sent to you via email. Please complete the process of activating your account before the prep day begins. 
* Go to https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu, to confirm you are able to acess and login. 
* As a reminder, we are asking all attendees to use the training accounts that we are providing, even if you already have your own account. This will minimize problems related to custom configurations (e.g., environment variables, choice of shell, etc.) that may cause some of the hands-on examples to break. This also gives participants access to the Expanse reservation created for the workshop.

 ## Computer Requirements: <a name="computer-req"></a>
* After you access your account information, confirm that you can login (SSH) to Expanse using the device you plan to use during the SDSC Summer Institute (laptop, workstation, etc...).  Detailed instructions on connecting to Expanse using SSH can be found [here](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/connecting-to-hpc-systems).  
* We recommend a second screen for the hands-on sessions. The first to view the presentation, the second for hands-on.
* For visualization tutorial a mouse with scroll wheel is highly recommended (laptop track pads are very difficult to use for 3D navigation).

##  Remote access via GitHub, Zoom, and Slack <a name="remote"></a>
* GitHub:  Preparation and training material will be located on the SDSC Summer Institute 2021 [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdsc/sdsc-summer-institute-2021) and one of the Thursday hands-on sessions will require a GitHub account. If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).   

* Zoom: You will need to install the latest [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download), which is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Once installed, you can test your microphone and camera interface with Zoom [here](https://zoom.us/test). You can find more information on Zoom system requirements, including bandwidth requirements [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux). 
  * To ensure the security of our Zoom links, details will be sent to all participants just prior to preparation day (July 28) and again prior to the Summer Institute week (August 2 - 6).  
  * When setting up your “display name” on Zoom, please list your FIRST name, LAST name, and institution (i.e., Jane Doe (SDSC)) 

* Slack: We will also be using Slack as our main platform for announcements, where participants can communicate and ask for help. Download ([Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [MacOS](https://slack.com/downloads/mac), or [Linux](https://slack.com/downloads/linux)) and get [started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users).  Zoom chat will be disabled. Make sure to turn on your notifications to receive alerts.
  * Once you have downloaded the client, join the SI-SDSC-2021 workspace. See "...Preparation & Exercise" email for link to join.   
  * When setting up your “display name” on Slack, please list your FIRST name, LAST name, and institution (i.e., Jane Doe (SDSC))
