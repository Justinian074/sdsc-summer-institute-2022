# Session 6.2 Scaling up Interactive Data Analysis in Jupyter Lab: From Laptop to HPC #

**Friday, August 5, 2022**

In this session we will demonstrate scaling up data analysis to larger than memory (out-of-core) datasets and processing them in parallel on CPU and GPU nodes. In the hands-on exercise we will compare Pandas, Dask, Spark, cuDF, and Dask-cuDF dataframe libraries for handling large datasets. We also cover setting up reproducible and transferable software environments for data analysis.
