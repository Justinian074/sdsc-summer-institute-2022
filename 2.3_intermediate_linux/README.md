Effective use of Linux based compute resources via the command line interface (CLI) can significantly increase researcher productivity. Assuming basic familiarity with the Linux CLI we cover some more advanced concepts with focus on the Bash shell. Among others this includes the filesystem hierarchy, file permissions, symbolic and hard links, wildcards and file globbing, finding commands and files, environment variables and modules, configuration files, aliases, history and tips for effective Bash shell scripting. 

**Code Samples**: The Examples directory contains the commands and files that will let you execute some of examples shown in the presentation.
