The new era of data science is here. Our lives as well as any field of science, engineering, business, and society are continuously transformed by our ability to collect meaningful data in a systematic fashion and turn that into value. These needs not only push for new and innovative capabilities in composable data management and analytical methods that can scale in an anytime anywhere fashion, but also require methods to bridge the gap between applications and compose such capabilities within solution architectures. 

In this short overview, we will show you a plethora of applications that are enabled by data science techniques and describe the process and cyberinfrastructure used within these projects to solve questions.
